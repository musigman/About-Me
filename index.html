        <h3>Bio:</h3>
        <p>Born and raised in the PNW. I love the outdoors especially paddling and mountain biking. I am in my first
          year
          of
          learning web development and I am enjoying the challenge. I wouldn't say it comes easy to me but I love the
          "aha"
          moment when it all clicks and then you see the results of what you built.</p>

        <h3>Job Experience:</h3>
        <p>Out of college I was doing the bookkeeping for my fathers business in automotive detailing. Long story short,
          a
          few years went by and before I knew it I was running the shop. This wasn't the plan but I ended up working
          there
          for over a decade. I loved the crew and the satisfaction of getting the job done. In January my father retired
          and it gave me a opportunity to start a new path in life which has brought me here to web development</p>

        <h3>Goals:</h3>
        <p>My goal is to become a self sufficient full stack web developer. I have already learned so much but also
          realize there is always so much more to learn! I am hoping to continue my education at Code Fellows through
          the
          301 and 401.</p>
